### Our research

Audio conversations, the associated metadata captured through TalkFutures, participants use of the service (comments, etc.) and engagement metrics when interacting 
with audio recordings (such as when it was paused or how long was spent annotating a conversation) are used to understand how digital tools can support yourself and 
other citizens engaging in qualitative research practices and how audio can make these processes more accessible.
