This service, Gabber, is part of a research project by [Open Lab](https://openlab.ncl.ac.uk/), [Newcastle University](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/). 
We collect data on how you interact with Gabber to inform our research as described below. 
Any published work resulting from data captured through Gabber will never include details that could be used to identify yourself or other participants.

### Our research

Audio conversations, the associated metadata captured through Gabber, participants use of the service (comments, etc.) and engagement metrics when interacting 
with audio recordings (such as when it was paused or how long was spent annotating a conversation) are used to understand how digital tools can support yourself and 
other citizens engaging in qualitative research practices and how audio can make these processes more accessible.
